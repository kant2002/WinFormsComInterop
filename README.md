ComWrappers required to run NativeAOT and WinForms
=====================================================

This repository has ComWrappers implementation for WinForms.
In additional to that, it allow use WinForms and NativeAOT and R2R with trimming together.

## Getting started

Just add `WinFormsComInterop` to your project.

	dotnet add package WinFormsComInterop

Then to your Program.cs add following line

	ComWrappers.RegisterForMarshalling(WinFormsComInterop.WinFormsComWrappers.Instance);

If you application will works with this ComWrappers implementation, then most likely it would work with NativeAOT.

## Testing technology

Test that normal CoreCLR works

	dotnet run --project samples\SampleWindowsForms\SampleWindowsForms.csproj
	dotnet run --project experiments\WpfTestBed\WpfTestBed.csproj
	dotnet run --project experiments\WinUITestBed\WinUITestBed\WinUITestBed.csproj
	dotnet run --project experiments\WinUIUWP\WinUIUWP.csproj

## NativeAOT
Test that NativeAOT works. 
Run commands in x64 developer tools.

### WinForms

	dotnet publish -r win-x64 samples\SampleWindowsForms\SampleWindowsForms.csproj
	"samples\SampleWindowsForms\bin\x64\Debug\net6.0-windows\win-x64\publish\SampleWindowsForms.exe"

Below are experimental projects. They are need additional work.

### WPF

	dotnet publish -r win-x64 experiments\WpfTestBed\WpfTestBed.csproj -p:GenerateWPF=true

 blocked by https://github.com/kant2002/WinFormsComInterop/issues/30

 ### WinUI

	dotnet publish -r win10-x64 experiments\WinUITestBed\WinUITestBed\WinUITestBed.csproj

### Classic UWP project

	dotnet publish -r win-x64 experiments\WinUIUWP\WinUIUWP.csproj

does not working due to this error 
```
experiments\WinUIUWP\WinUIUWP.csproj : error MSB4057: The target "Restore" does not exist in the project.
```

## For brave souls

Mostly notes for me, but maybe somebody would like to hack.

Build (NativeAOT)[https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/NativeAOT].

Modify nuget.config
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <!--To inherit the global NuGet package sources remove the <clear/> line below -->
    <clear />
    <!--Locally built version of NativeAOT -->
    <add key="ILC" value="c:\runtimelab\artifacts\packages\Debug\Shipping\" />
    <!--To use daily builds of runtime -->
    <add key="dotnet6" value="https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet6/nuget/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

Restore packages to local folder to not pollute global Nuget cache. You will build NativAOT a lot.

	dotnet restore -r win-x64 --packages packages

Then publish applications using regular workflow described above.
